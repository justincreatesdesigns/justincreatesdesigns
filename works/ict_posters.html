          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Working in a secondary school enviroment as a IT professional, we
            deal with many issues such as hardware, software or whatever magical
            thing that may happen during the term. These posters are to counter
            a few of those minute problems.
          </p>

          <div class="article-img brand-spacer-30">
            <img
              src="/img/ict_poster_all.png"
              alt="ict poster graphic design"
            />
          </div>

          <h2>Observation</h2>
          <p>
            A few of my tasks were related to handling students directly and
            there are a few common issues that my team and I face day to day. So
            I started oberserving closely and felt that these common issues can
            can be resolved just with design.
          </p>

          <h3>Common things are:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Forcing the button locked door open and getting confused on why it
              doesn't open.
            </li>
            <li>
              SD Cards passed to me with no name or indication of which event it
              was shot for.
            </li>
            <li>
              Forms of long queues infront of the office due to them forgetting
              their password.
            </li>
            <li>
              Knocking on the door (+ continuously knocking it when no one opens
              it within a short time) even when there is a clear bell there to
              be pressed.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>
            After countless repeated instructions and epic fails, I thought why
            not put my skills to work and visually communicate with them
            instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            From my POV, students are more keen to be attracted to pretty
            visuals and can understand them easily if you have the right graphic
            or message.
          </p>

          <h2>The Plan</h2>

          <p>
            I started mapping out my limitations first. A few of them were lack
            of time due to work, there is a EPSON P6000 Printer but it will be
            overkill just for a few small ones around the office, and coloured
            printer is all the way on the other side of school which can be a
            hassle when in need of reprinting at a moments notice.
          </p>

          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <p>So I concluded that I will have to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Print in Black and White for convenience as well as accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              A4 paper because its everywhere in the office and can easily be
              replenished instead of using the poster paper rolls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Visuals that are not only appealing but can also meet the standard
              of conveying the message to the kids.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some form of consistent identity so that it can be easily
              recognized and repeated.
            </li>
          </ol>
